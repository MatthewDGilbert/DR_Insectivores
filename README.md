ABSTRACT

Niche partitioning is at the heart of interspecific competition. The Competitive Exclusion Principle states that species must fill different niches to coexist, which can be reflected by differences in foraging behavior. New World Warblers (family Parulidae) have been subject to intensive study on this topic on breeding grounds in North America, but competition on migratory warblers' non-breeding grounds has received relatively little attention. We hypothesize that evidence of niche partitioning would be suggested by differences in foraging behavior among the insectivorous migrants and resident species at our study site in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. We gathered standardized behavioral data on eight wintering warbler species as well as two resident insectivores, Broad-billed Tody (Todus subulatus) and Black-Whiskered Vireo (Vireo altiloquus). We found significant differences in foraging attack technique between the residents and all migrants. Most migrant species exhibited differences among one another in their foraging heights, habitat preferences, or foraging substrates. Significant evidence for differences in foraging behavior were found among 89 out of 90 pairwise comparisons between species. The lack of overlap in niche between migrants and residents suggests that these residents may undergo seasonal ecological release, or that the foliage-gleaner niches may remain unfilled in the summer.
